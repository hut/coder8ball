# coder8ball

The 8ball for lazy repository maintainers.

Have you ever been confronted with having to maintain a software which other
people started to use, and now bug reports are piling up?  Here is the
solution.  No need to think for yourself, the magic coder8ball will tell you
what to do.

# Example

```
~ $ coder8ball
Explain that their particular system configuration isn't supported.
~ $ coder8ball
Close without explanation.
~ $ coder8ball
Pretend it's a problem with systemd.
```

# Bugs

If you find any bugs in this software, just go ahead and open an issue.  I will
then pretend that I'm actively working on the issue.
